In this chapter we describe a very popular coding algorithm called the Huffman coding algorithm. We first present a procedure for building Huffman codes when the probability model for the source is known, then a procedure for building codes when the source statistics are unknown. We also describe a few techniques for code design that are in some sense similar to the Huffman coding approach. Finally, we give some examples of using the Huffman code for image compression, audio compression, and text compression
